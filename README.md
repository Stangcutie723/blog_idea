An Application blog of Love Letters

I got rather upset with my last assignment, well how it turned out in 3 hours. After a tough run of trying <br>
to complete it in 3 hours with no real idea of what to do or how to do it I decided if I could't fix it then <br>
I would try again with another 3 hour run. This time I am happy. It's a little old fashioned but I'm okay with<br>
that.

This app lets a specific user login, add love letters (blog posts) to her "Love book". The readers can add comments<br>
to the letters and so can the author. I thought it was kinda cute. Anyway:
Assignment Details are as follows: <br>
3 hours to complete <br>
Project params must have 2 or more of the following: <br>
Nested Resources  *This made things very simple*
Devise
Authorization *I added a small authorization action. Bascially only allowing the user edit comments.*
Associations
Something you learned about in a Lightning Talk: *I implemented comments to my love letter blog*
