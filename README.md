An Application blog of Love Letters

I got rather upset with my last assignment, well how it turned out in 3 hours. After a tough run of trying <br>
to complete it in 3 hours with no real idea of what to do or how to do it I decided if I could't fix it then <br>
I would try again with another 3 hour run. This time I am happy. It's a little old fashioned but I'm okay with<br>
that.


The app lets you add love letters and as many comments as you or others want. Each comment can be from a different commenter
while on the same page! This app lets a specific user login to delete the comments, and love letters (blog posts) to her "Love book". <br>

Assignment Details are as follows: <br>
3 hours to complete <br>
Project params must have 2 or more of the following: <br>
Nested Resources  *This made things very simple regarding the posts and comments*<br>
Devise: Did not use on this assignment<br> 
Authorization *I added a delete only authorization. So only one person (the owner) can delete anything*<br>
Associations:Did not use on this assignment<br>
Something you learned about in a Lightning Talk: *I implemented the comment idea to my love letter blog as well as trying to make it presentable. I love text on black background, it's easier for me to read while testing.* <br>

View Updates: These I used two completely different methods. For one I used the simple t = Time.now and the other I implemented
a method regarding a timeago. Both were interesting to play around with. Below are pictures of the results.<br>
