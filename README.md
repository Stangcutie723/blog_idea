An Application blog of Love Letters
The app lets a user add love letters and as many comments as you or others want. Each comment can be from a different commenter
while on the same page! This app lets a specific user login to delete the comments, and love letters (blog posts) to her "Love book". <br>

Known Bugs:
==========
There is a bug related to the twitter login. OmniAuth Error. This will be fixed in a later version.


Includes:
=============
Nested Resources  *This made things very simple regarding the posts and comments*<br>
Authorization *I added a delete only authorization. So only one person (the owner) can delete anything*<br>
Something you learned about in a Lightning Talk: *I implemented the comment idea to my love letter blog as well as trying to make it presentable. I love text on black background, it's easier for me to read while testing.* <br>
